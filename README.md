# PTVDownloader
A Python tool to download the current day's Pathway To Victory podcast

#### Why Did I Make This?
Pathway To Victory is a production of First Baptist Church of Dallas' pastor Dr. Robert Jeffress. They have it in a podcast version, but they only keep the previous two week's podcasts. I wanted an easy way to keep all of them, but it it really kind of hard to figure out how to download them. I'm sure somewhere there is an archive of old podcasts, but if I knew about it, I wouldn't have had the opportunity to play around with and learn Beautiful Soup. I'm planning on setting it up as a cronjob. Hopefully you find it as useful as I do.
